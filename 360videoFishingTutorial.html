                <h1>360 Video Fishing Tutorial</h1>
                <p>
                    In my second year of college, during the first semester, I worked on a project that involved VR and
                    video
                    editing. The assignment was designed to give us experience in both video editing and VR programming.
                    Our group
                    had members with varying skill sets, so we delegated tasks based on individual strengths.</p>

                <p>
                    We started by brainstorming ideas for the type of VR experience we wanted to create. We didn't just
                    want the
                    client to have a passive experience through video; we wanted them to interact with the content and
                    learn from
                    it. Our initial ideas revolved around recording at the zoo, which would offer plenty of
                    opportunities for
                    interaction through various animal exhibits. However, we ultimately decided to create a tutorial
                    that teaches
                    people how to fish.</p>

                <p>
                    Our tutorial highlighted fishing spots in Boise, Idaho, and other nearby locations. My
                    responsibility was the
                    recording and editing of the videos, as well as some of the sound design.</p>



                <p>
                    The primary limitation of our project was the lack of time to refine and polish it further. Despite
                    this, the
                    final product was a satisfactory experience that taught users how to get a fishing license, where to
                    fish in
                    Boise, and the basics of fishing itself. Fishing requires patience, but it also demands enough
                    interactivity to
                    keep people engaged, which is why we chose it as our subject.

                    This project not only improved my video editing and sound design skills, but it also gave me
                    experience in
                    delegating tasks and collaborating effectively with others.</p>
