                <p>This is a Grupe game that me and my Group members were assigned to make.
                    We were given an idea about superposition and we needed to make a game around that concept. Our
                    group had to do a lot of research and planning in order to make an idea of what the game might
                    become. With the research that we have done we decided to play with our strengths and made a 2D game
                    that explores superposition and the fourth dimension.
                </p>

                

                <p>I was responsible for the art style and how I could represent the fourth dimension and time travel
                    mechanics in such an art style.
                </p>

                

                <p>I was also responsible for the animations and the art for the levels.</p>

                

                <p>It was really fun coming up with ideas and brainstorming on what kind of game we could make after we
                    did our research on superposition. The assignment was supposed to be an interactive comic. But since
                    we didn't have the art skills we decided on making a 2D game that was narrative driven. The premise
                    of the game is that you are a fourth dimensional being and your powers have been stolen from your
                    future self. By going on a series of challenges, you collect the books that regain your power.
                    Eventually, you will collect the last book which would give you the power to go into the future as a
                    fourth dimension being.</p>
