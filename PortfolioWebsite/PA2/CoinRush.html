                <h1>Coin Rush</h1>
                <hr>

                <p>This is the first project that I got to work on in Gimm in my first semester. It's an individual game
                    assignment.
                    I was given a stub game and I had to make it into an interesting and playable game with its own
                    systems
                    mechanics movement and art assets.</p>

                <p>I decided to make a 2D platform game that relied on speed and precision in its game play loop.
                    The objective of the game is to collect as many coins as possible. The timer resets every time a
                    coin is
                    collected and the player gets transported onto another level immediately to keep the momentum. And
                    the game is
                    over when the player fails to collect the coin before the time ends.
                </p>


                <p>I had no prior knowledge of code when I was assigned to make this game so it became immediately clear
                    to me that
                    i had to learn how to use unity and how to code in C# in order to complete this project.</p>

                <p>It was a very challenging project but I was able to complete it and I am very proud of the result.
                </p>

                <p>I am in charge of all of the art assets that are made in this game, including the animations.
                    I wanted to go for a pixel art futuristic aesthetic for the art style of the game.</p>
